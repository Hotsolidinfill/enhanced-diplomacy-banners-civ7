# zhekoff's Enhanced Diplomacy Banners

## [1.1.1] - 2025-02-23
- As each era can dynamically insert statistics (e.g. Antiquity Era can show Population count, Cities, Towns, and then hide this information in the next era), I have hardcoded it so all of the mod stat trackers are visible at all times.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-02-23
- New background for the diplomacy banners.
- Relationship icons are moved in the bottom, as they took up too much free space on the previous location (and causing an always empty space for the local player banner).
- Added new stat trackers - total gold, influence and population.
- Added a seperator between per-turn trackers and total trackers.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-09
- Initial release
