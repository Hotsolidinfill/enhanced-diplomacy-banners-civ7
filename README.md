# zhekoff's Enhanced Diplomacy Banners

A Civilization 7 mod that provides a more compact and enhanced UI for diplomacy banners.

* Compact UI - removes redundant elements that took up way too much space on the screen (ribbons, symbols and background containers).
* Re-organized relationship icons - banners for leaders you are at war with will have a different background color).
* New stat trackers, that appear on hover - total gold treasury, total influence amount and total population.
* Minor UI adjustments

## Installation

1. Download the latest release.
2. Extract the contents into your `{user}\AppData\Local\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VII\Mods` folder.

## Compatibility

The mod was made for 1.0.1 Patch 3.

I have still not fully modularized this mod, so it will have conflicts with any mods that are modifying the **panel-diplo-ribbon.js** and **model-diplo-ribbon.js**.

## Future Plans

* More stat trackers, like Military Strength / Victory Scores.
* Customizable stat trackers.
