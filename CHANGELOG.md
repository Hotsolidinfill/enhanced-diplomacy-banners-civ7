# zhekoff's Enhanced Diplomacy Banners

## [1.3.1] - 2025-03-08
 - Fix bug that would break the attribute trees
 - Fix bug that would have the attribute icon shown behind the leader portrait

## [1.3.0] - 2025-03-08
 - Make leaders portraits circular, as that fits more with the design of the mod
 - Replace relationship icons with circular icons (mostly inspired by Civilization VI emoji's). They are also now part of the leader portrait.
 - Re-designed war support count banner
 - Restore proper hovering animations for leader portraits, and animations when their turn is active
 - Add identity to the Civilization banners - we have a banner strip (with the color of the player) visible with the Civilization symbol inside.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-03-06
- Make compatible with Patch 1.1.0 for Civ VII
- Modularize the mod, so it does not make conflicts with any other mods that modify the same files
- Added color indicators for each civilization, so there is better visual communication
- Detailed stats will be displayed only when you hover over the banner for a player, making it even more compact
- Move the diplomacy banners further to the right of the screen
- Add Korean localization (thanks to @Hotsolidinfill)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-02-23
- As each era can dynamically insert statistics (e.g. Antiquity Era can show Population count, Cities, Towns, and then hide this information in the next era), I have hardcoded it so all of the mod stat trackers are visible at all times.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-02-23
- New background for the diplomacy banners.
- Relationship icons are moved in the bottom, as they took up too much free space on the previous location (and causing an always empty space for the local player banner).
- Added new stat trackers - total gold, influence and population.
- Added a seperator between per-turn trackers and total trackers.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-09
- Initial release
