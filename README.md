# zhekoff's Enhanced Diplomacy Banners

A Civilization 7 mod that provides a more compact and enhanced UI for diplomacy banners.

* Compact UI - removes redundant elements that took up way too much space on the screen (ribbons, symbols and background containers).
* Re-organized relationship icons - banners for leaders you are at war with will have a different background color).
* New stat trackers, that appear on hover - total gold treasury, total influence amount and total population.
* Minor UI adjustments
